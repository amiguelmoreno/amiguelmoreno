<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Miguel Moreno 🙋🏻‍♂️</h1>
<br><br/>
<p>  
  I am currently part of 42 Malaga, one of the most innovative programming campus in the world, with a pioneering pedagogical model based on peer learning and gamification where teamwork is essential for success. 🍍

Parallel to 42, I study Front-End Development, delving into HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, React, as well as other essential frameworks and libraries. 💻
  
  Here, you will find all the interesting projects that I have done or I'm currently doing. I hope you like it and enjoy! 😁👍
